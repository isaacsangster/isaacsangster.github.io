        <p>During my time at Dalhousie, I've had the opportunity to work on many different coding assignments.</p>
        <p>
            In the video below is a program that I created to find what number has the largest Collatz Sequence between 1 and the number inputted.
            This outputs the number entered, the number with the highest collatz sequence, and how many steps are in that sequence, as well as the time elapsed.
        </p>
        <div class="grid">
            <p>For context, a collatz sequence is the steps the algorithm takes until it reaches 1 from an inputted integer. If input is even, it divides by 2. If it is odd, it multiplies by 3 and adds 1. Every finite number has a collatz sequence. </p>

            <p> Another project I completed was a basic password system, which detects whether you inputted the password incorrectly for the corresponding username. Upon successful entry, it greets the user.</p>
