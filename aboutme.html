          <p>
              I have lived in Nova Scotia for most of my life, but when I first started my University
              adventure, I was at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's. There I was studying chemistry
              when I realized after almost two years that it wasn't enjoyable to me. I made the happy switch over to
              computer science and decided to stay local to my hometown and study in Halifax! I've always been an outgoing
              person in and out of the workplace and I am capable of adapting to almost any work environment. I would never turn down
              a challenge, especially if learning is involved. All my life I loved to learn deeper about topics which interest me, and
              being in computer science really showed me that there is <i>a lot</i> more to appreciate and learn about than I previously
              imagined being a chemistry student. With more than 6 years of customer service, combined with my love for this field, I would make
              a great addition to your team.

      <p> One of the first videos that made me reconsider my career path was the CS50 lectures uploaded for free by Harvard. I put one of the lectures related to C below. </p>
